The iterative (single-threaded) server must support the following client requests:

    Date and Time - the date and time on the server
    Uptime - how long the server has been running since last boot-up
    Memory Use - the current memory usage on the server
    Netstat - lists network connections on the server
    Current Users - list of users currently connected to the server
    Running Processes - list of programs currently running on the server

When the server program is launched, the server should

    Listen for client requests on the specified network address and port
    When a client request is received, the server should
        Determine which operation is being requested
        Perform the requested operation and collect the resulting output
        Reply to the client request with the output from the operation performed
    Perform any necessary clean up activities
    Go back to listening for client requests
